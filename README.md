# Sonar
 Secure messaging application based on the <a href="https://github.com/Sharkgrammer/shark-protocol">shark messaging protocol</a>
 
 Its is a decentralised, secure messaging platform. If you worry about your messages being seen by some entity, Sonar is the
 application for you. All your data is located on your phone, no data is located on a server.
 
 Using Sonar, you can send messages and images to any of your friends. You can also choose from several different colour themes for
 each conversation. Using QR codes you talk to anyone from any place. 
 Each message sent through Sonar is encrypted and locked multiple times before being sent. Then, each server on the decentralised
 network decrypts and unlocks one layer of this encryption before sending it to the next server.
 
 Sonar is a work in progress and will go through numerous changes and possible outages through development.
